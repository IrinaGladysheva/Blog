# Blog
This experimentation was supposed to be a time of learning html and css
to be able to build my own personal blog. Here you could find the home page,
the about page, and the works page. I would like to continue learning html and css
as to be able to create those 3 pages, I read some documentation, watched some videos,
and followed the tutorials. I would need to keep working on it to feel comfortable with
my skills.
